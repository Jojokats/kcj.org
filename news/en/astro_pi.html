Exciting news: for the first time, kids across Canada are invited by the European Space Agency (ESA) to launch their code into space 
with Astro Pi's Mission Zero! Astro Pi is an annual science and coding competition by the Raspberry Pi Foundation where student-written
code is run on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 seconds.

<br><br>
To celebrate, Code Club Canada (a project by Kids Code Jeunesse) is hosting free Python Sense-HAT workshops for kids aged 10 to 12 
across the country. These workshops are taking place in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Waterloo, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Sudbury. This 
means you can be one of the first Canadian children to have your code in space! 

<br><br>

The submitted projects will contribute to the daily routine of the International Space Station by measuring the ambient air temperature
and displaying a personal message on the Astro Pi. Each team will receive a certificate stating the date and time their code was 
executed on the ISS. 

<br><br>
To take part in Astro Pi, kids have to work in teams of 2 or more. No one can work alone, so bring a friend! Parents must register 
two kids per ticket and bring proof of registration to the event, but they themselves do not require a ticket to enter the workshop. 
All workshops will be open to 10 teams in total. Each team has to complete their project by the end of the workshop for submission to 
Astro Pi. Space is limited, so register early, mark your calendar, and prepare for liftoff!
