    A project with Kids Code Jeunesse, Code Club Canada is a network of
    volunteers and educators who run free, extra-curricular coding clubs
    for children in local venues in every province across the country. Code
    Club Canada has over 135 clubs, with projects translated in 28 different
    languages. These projects give kids between 8 and 12 years old the opportunity
     to learn programs like Scratch, HTML and Python in a collaborative and 
     creative environment. With resources accessible to anyone,
    kids can code their animations, create webpages using HTML or use
    Python to develop their own games. You can access these projects at
    <a href="https://codeclubprojects.org/">codeclubprojects.org</a>
