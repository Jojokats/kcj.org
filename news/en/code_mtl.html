    This year, we partnered up with la <a href="http://fondationcsdm.org/" target="_blank">Fondation de la Commission Scolaire de Montréal</a> to develop <a href="http://codemtl.org" target="_blank">Code MTL</a> - a project that would bring code to primary school students all across Montreal.
    <br><br>
    We are excited to say that after months of creation, development and testing, the Fondation CSDM launched Code MTL this September. Together, we are aiming to reach 28 000 students from 8 to 12 year old, throughout the primary schools of the CSDM. Kids Code Jeunesse instructors will be guiding the students, side-by-side with teachers who were eager to volunteer for the project. At this stage, the program already has 3240 students participating, 135 teachers volunteering and 65 schools signed up. 
    <br><br>
    Each participating student will have the chance to experience computer programming during an 8-week course, where they will learn to code with the use of Scratch - a block coding program developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Montreal’s Playful Invention Company. 
    <br><br>
    With Code MTL, both students and teachers of the CSDM will significantly improve their digital literacy skills by integrating code into the primary school curriculum. Treating computer science as a core competency for children will not only improve their problem-solving skills and spark creative computational thinking, but it will beneficially inform their use of technology in the future. 
    <br><br>
    We want to thank la Fondation CSDM for bringing us on board and for choosing to inspire children in Montreal through code.
