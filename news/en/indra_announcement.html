As we work to reach Canada’s each and every corner, we look for people who are driven and passionate about education to grow with us along the way. This year, we welcomed more volunteers, regional coordinators, lead instructors, and a new member of KCJ’s core team: Indra Kubicek. 
<br><br>
Indra is now on board with us as our Operations Director - a new position that involves overseeing KCJ’s day to day operations, supporting all regional coordinators and making sure that our Canada-wide activities are running smoothly. With a background as a Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant, Indra worked as the Director of Finance, Operations and International Development for Code Club, based in London, U.K., and once it merged with the Raspberry Pi, she became the Director of Code Club International. Channeling her previous experiences and valuable skillsets into her new position, Indra will guide KCJ's developing operations and growth.

We are very excited to welcome Indra to our team and are eager to work together on growing Kids Code Jeunesse and inspiring more kids with code!
