<p>We’re kicking off the new school year with a week-long extravaganza of science: the annual Science Literacy Week. From the 18th to the 24th of September 2017, all of Canada is coming together to “showcase the excellence and diversity of Canadian science and to show how exciting science is” (Jesse Hildebrand, www.scienceliteracy.ca). With events spanning across the country and highlighting the multiple facets of science, there is something for every curious mind in the country. 
<br><br>
To celebrate Science Literacy Week, Kids Code Jeunesse will be running free workshops in libraries and community centres across Canada. We will be in Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, celebrating science and literacy..  Our workshops will invite children to build a coding project based on the space-themed book The Darkest Dark by real-life astronaut, Chris Hadfield. These projects will then be available online for libraries and schools, in both English and French.
<br><br>
We are super excited to be part of Science Literacy and to promote science with an experimental and artistic twist.
