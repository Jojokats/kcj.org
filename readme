Resources
	When adding files to the Resources_pdf folder keep the naming of the files exactly the same in both
	the englis (EN folder tree) and the french (FR folder tree). This is only to prevent any cunfosion or
	any overcomplicating the pathing. 
	FOR EXAMPLE:
		in the EN resources.html the link to a pdf file would be:
			Resources_pdf/windows/In-Classroom/EN/Primary/Python/KCJ_Python_Lesson5.pdf
		
		in the FR resources.html the link would be:
			Resources_pdf/windows/In-Classroom/FR/Primary/Python/KCJ_Python_Lesson5.pdf
							   ^
							as you can see only the FR was switched.
	ALSO, if a power point is being added (.pptx the .txt/.pdf of power points), add the the 
	"resources_link" class to the a tag
		EXAMPLE:
			  <a class="resources_link" href="example.pptx" target="_blank">
