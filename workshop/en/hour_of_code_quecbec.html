    <i>“Hour of code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed to demystify "code", to show that anybody can learn the basics, and to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding activities but expanding to all sorts of community efforts.”

    As part of this year's Hour of Code, Kids Code Jeunesse will be offering free 2-hour coding workshops across Canada! These workshops will invite children to create a simple game with the micro:bit, a fun, interactive, and hands-on pocket-sized, codeable computer that allows you to get creative with code! Explore the world of code and exercise your critical thinking, problem-solving and creativity with us!
